# Hello-world
My repository on GitHub
This is my first practice to Netlify. 
I have made: 
> 1. Create a GitHub repo from scratch
>> Milestone 1: Open a fresh directory with no git history (hint: make a new dir that is not under any git dir)
>> 
>> Milestone 2: Add HTML, CSS, and JS file
>> 
>> Milestone 3: In HTML, add Heading 1 as Hello world!
>> 
>> Milestone 4: In CSS, change world to a different color
>> 
>> Milestone 5: In JS, add code so that your name shows on the web.
>> 
>> Milestone 6: Follow This guide to make a GitHub repo from an fresh local directory
>> 
>> Milestone 7: Add a README.md file that looks like this using Markdown guide
> 2. Deploy to netlify
